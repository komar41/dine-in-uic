# Dine-In UIC: Navigate Large Food Halls with Ease

<div style="text-align: justify">
This project was originated from an identified issue faced by university students with dietary restrictions, particularly those frequenting UIC's United Table in Student Center East. Through a series of six interviews emphasizing the "what, how, and why," we sought to understand the challenges these students encounter while searching for safe food options.

The subsequent phases involved the development of low-fidelity prototypes, guided by the identified user needs, and the translation of these prototypes into a finalized mobile application during the delivery phase. The technical architecture of our application relies on React Native with Expo CLI, React Components, and local JSON data for dynamic menu retrieval, employing a generative AI tool for dish images, all while avoiding a separate database by locally storing persistent data.

The app evaluation involves a comparative study between our developed mobile application and an existing solution, "Dine on Campus," to address user needs gathered from interviews. Participants, exposed to both apps, performed tasks within the dining hallâ€”identifying foods meeting their dietary restrictions and locating these items within the space.

- Here, the user will be recommended a list of food items based on their dietary preferences they set up in the previous screen.
- The user can then set up their meal plan for that day and save it.
- The user can also check dish details by clicking on any food item. It will take them to the **Dish Details** screen.
- After saving their plan, the user then will be taken to the **Home** screen again.
- From **Home**, the user can then check their plan using **My Plan** screen or navigate to the **Map** screen.
